![ic_launcher_logo_main_circle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66693732/84262687-a782aa80-ab3b-11ea-8ebf-bfb8d40d61a1.png)

Food Freak is an online canteen ordering application for college students and staffs.

## The main objective of the application :

The current manual ordering process in the canteen has many disadvantages which sometimes even leads to loss. It is tedious and requires a lot of manual work which can be replaced with automation. I have successfully developed "Food Freak" and an android application which will cut the manual work in half. There will be no need for following the traditional token system, it will be completely replaced with the application. The user will not have to face huge queues both at the canteen and the token counter.
The data which is written on the register every day at the counter will be replaced with an online database which is going to keep track of all the orders throughout the day. The access to the database will be at the finger tips of the canteen manager. 

The objective of my project is to minimize the time and effort of students and staff when they order food in the canteen by automating the existing manual process.

## Food Feak includes the following features :
- User Register/Login for both admin and student.
- OTP authentication.
- Real time items available in different canteens.
- Admin can add new item to canteen menu anytime.
- Students can check items availability and order at anytime.
- User can pick up the item after successful completion of order.
- and alot more....

## Future improvements
1. Improved performance : Sometimes due to slow internet connection the application takes alot of time to fetch the data from the server so it leads to delay which needs to be fixed
2. Adding payment option: I have not integrated a inbuilt payment system in the application which when Implemented will be implemented.
3. Push notification: Push notification will help user to get updates without even opening the application.
4. Adding bestseller option : Bestseller items will help to know which item is most liked in that canteen
5. Integrate google login: It will ease the process of creating account.
